Subsequent Turns: After the first turn, players can only click on tiles that already have their own colour. Clicking a tile with your colour adds 1 point to that tile.The background colour indicates the next player.
Conquest and Expansion: When a tile with your colour reaches 4 points, it triggers an expansion:
The colour completely disappears from the original tile.
Your colour spreads to the four surrounding squares in a plus shape (up, down, left, right).
Each of the four surrounding squares gains 1 point with your colour.
If any of the four has your opponentâ€™s colour, you conquer the opponent's points on that tile while adding a point to it, completely erasing theirs.
The expansion is retriggered if the neighbouring tile as well reaches 4 points this way.
Players take turns clicking on tiles and the objective is to eliminate your opponent's colour entirely from the screen."
